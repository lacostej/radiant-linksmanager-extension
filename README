= Links Manager

Small extension to manage links. The extensions provides an admin tab to create links 
and a redirect controller to use them. The links have a name, a url and an optional description.
The redirect controller is available to your site and let you use site internal urls for
internal or external resources. This is useful to track linking to external resources, and for
providing known URLs to internal resources whose path isn't controlled (e.g. page attachments).

The implementation is very crude so far. 

Potential improvements:
* add automated tests
* link model constraints (name uniqueness...)
* error handling
* allow to override default redirect controller URI (/redirect/)
* ...
